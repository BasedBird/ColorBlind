# What is ColorBlind?

ColorBlind is a browser-based game written in javascript that is our submission for the Hack@Home Hackathon hosted by Brown University. The intention is to provide a source for social interaction during self-isolation. Each player can only see a subset of the threats and the map, so in order to have a sliver of a chance of beating the game, players would need to coordinate with one another intensely. Unfortunately, time constraints during the hackathon only gave us enough time to create a single player version.

# How does it work?

ColorBlind is similar to many 2D top-down style games: there's mazes to navigate and traps and enemies to avoid by controlling your character with WASD. You only get one life, so make it count; once you get hit, you'll have to press R to restart and try again. What's different about ColorBlind is that you can only see walls belonging to one of four colors at a time; toggle between them using left click.

# Future Plans

As stated previously ColorBlind was meant to be a multiplayer game; players would be stripped of the ability to toggle through seeing different colors, and instead each player would only be able to see walls of a single color. It'd be up to each player to communicate what they're seeing so that everyone else doesn't get lost. And this color blind system wouldn't just apply to walls; our original idea was to make every enemy, trap, and powerup only visible to one player.
